## Check for BST

A binary search tree (BST) is a node based binary tree data structure which has the following properties. 
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
