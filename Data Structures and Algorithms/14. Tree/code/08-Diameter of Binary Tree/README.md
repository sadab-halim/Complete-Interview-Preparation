## Diameter of Binary Tree

The diameter of binary tree also known as (width of binary tree) is the number of nodes on the longest path between two end nodes.

The diameter of a tree T is the largest of the following quantities:
- the diameter of T's left subtree
- the diameter of T's right subtree
- the longest path between leaves that goes through the root of T
