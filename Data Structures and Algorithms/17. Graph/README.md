# Graph

## What is Graph in Data Structure?
A Graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of nodes and edges which connect them.

**Nodes:** connect the edges and create the main network of a graph. They are also called *Vertices*.

**Edges:** connects the nodes in a graph data structure. They represent the relationships between various nodes in a graph. Edges are also called the *path* in a triangle.

A Graph Data Structure(V, E) consists of:
- A collection of vertices (V) or nodes.
- A collection of edges (E) or path.

### Terminologies:

## Types of Graph:
1. **Directed Graph:** in graph data structure are the graphs where the edges have directions from one node towards the other node.

In Directed Graphs, we can only traverse from one node to another if the edge have a direction pointing to that node.

2. **Undirected Graphs:** Undirected graphs have edges that do not have a direction. Hence, the graph can be traversed in either direction.

## Graph Representation
The most commonly used representations of a graph are as follows:
1. Adjancency Matrix
2. Adjacency List
