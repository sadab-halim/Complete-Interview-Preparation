# Meeting Maximum Guests
Consider a big party where a log register for guestâ€™s entry and exit times is maintained. Find the time at which there are maximum guests in the party. Note that entries in register are not in any order.

```
Example:

Input: arrl[] = {1, 2, 9, 5, 5}
       exit[] = {4, 5, 12, 9, 12}

Explanation: First guest in array arrives at 1 and leaves at 4, second guest arrives at 2 and leaves at 5, and so on.

Output: 5
There are maximum 3 guests at time 5
```
