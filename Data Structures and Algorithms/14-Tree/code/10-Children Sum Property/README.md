## Check children sum property in a binary tree

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if the binary tree holds children-sum property. <br/>

For a tree to satisfy the children-sum property, each nodeâ€™s value should be equal to the sum of values at its left and right subtree. The value of an empty node is considered as 0.
