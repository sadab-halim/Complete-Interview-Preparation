# Object Oriented Programming System Notes

## Overview
### What is Object Oriented Programming?
### How Object Oriented Programming is related to the real world?
### Why to study OOPS?
### Limitations of OOPS

## Pillar of OOPS
## What is Class? <br/>
Collection of objects is called Class. It is a logical entity.

### Difference between Class and Structure <br/>
| Class | Structure |
| ----- | --------- |
| Members of a class are private by default | Members of a class are private by default |
| Base classes/structures of a class are private by default | Base classes/structures of a structure are public by default |
| It is declared using the class keyword | It is declared using the struct keyword |
| It is reference type | It is a value type |
| It is used for Data abstraction and further inheritance | It is used for grouping of data |
| It can have NULL values | It cannot have NULL values |
| It may have all the types of constructors and destructors | It may have only parameterized constructor |


### Similarities between Structure and Class
### Access Modifiers
- Public
- Private
- Protected
- Friend

### Member Function
- Inside Class Function
- Outside Class Function

### What is Constructor?
- Default Constructor
- Parameterised Constructor
- Copy Constructor
- Virtual Constructor
- Virtual Copy Constructor
- How constructors are different from a normal member function?
- Can we have more than one constructor in a class?
## What is an Object?


### Real world analogy of Class and Object?
### Important Keywords
## Features of OOPS
### Polymorphism
### Inheritance
### Encapsulation
### Abstraction

### Dynamic Binding
### Message Binding

## Object Oriented Design Interview Questions

### Design a Call Center
### Design a Parking Lot
### Design an Online Chat

## Miscellaneous

### Is it possible for a class to inherit the constructor of its base class?
### When should I use a struct instead of a class?
### Cohesion vs Coupling
